# PythonNumMethods
### A collection of mathematical automation programs, written in Python 3.

Done as a side project during summer (after going over numerical methods used in Engineering Maths), I've decided to share the programs that I've made in Python which had helped me understand the methods, and other topics, further.

I hope that it would prove useful to you as well, whether you're going over the numerical methods (or other topics) & is as confused as I was, or if you're using them for whatever reason, or even if you're just lurking around.

The programs are licensed in GNU GPLv3.

### Pre-requisites

Your machine must (obviously) have Python, of version 3 or greater

You must have MatPlotLib, Numpy, and Scipy installed (to confirm this, check within the files you wish to use)

Other required external modules will be notified within the specific files, but generally these three modules are a necessity to make these programs work
