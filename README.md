# PythonNumMethods
### A collection of mathematical automation programs, written in Python 3.

Done as a side project during summer (after going over numerical methods used in Engineering Maths), I've decided to share the programs that I've made in Python which had helped me understand the methods, and other topics, further.

I hope that it would prove useful to you as well, whether you're going over the numerical methods (or other topics) & is as confused as I was, or if you're using them for whatever reason, or even if you're just lurking around.

The programs are licensed in GNU GPLv3.
